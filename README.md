# My Pet Classifier

This project was made to practice the deployment of a Machine Learning Model on Hugging Face Spaces.

The PetClassifier was made by using the pre-trained image classification model [resnet34](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet34.html). I was inspired by [2: Deployment](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html) class of the course [Pratical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) by fastai.
